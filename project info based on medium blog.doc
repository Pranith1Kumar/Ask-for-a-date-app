Let's break down the steps to set up an EC2 instance on AWS and deploy the "Ask for a Date" app.

Step 1: Set up EC2 on AWS

Launch an Amazon EC2 instance:
Go to the EC2 console and select "Launch Instance".
Choose "Ubuntu" as the Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
Follow the prompts to configure the instance details, such as instance type, storage, and security group.
Configure security group:
Make sure to allow inbound traffic on port 80, which is the default port used by HTTP.
Connect to EC2 via SSH

Use the command ssh -i "mykey.pem" ubuntu@ec2–54–197–62–157.compute-1.amazonaws.com to connect to your EC2 instance.
Run the following commands

sudo su to switch to the root user.
apt update to update the package list.
apt install git to install Git.
git clone https://github.com/Aakibgithuber/Ask-for-a-date-app.git to clone the GitHub repository.
Step 2: Set up Nginx and Docker

Install Nginx:
sudo apt install nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx to start the Nginx service.
sudo systemctl enable nginx to enable Nginx to start on boot.
sudo systemctl status nginx to verify that Nginx is running without any errors.
Install Docker:
apt-get install docker.io
usermod -aG docker $USER to add the current user to the Docker group.
newgrp docker to apply the changes.
sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock to grant full read, write, and execute permissions to all users for the Docker socket file.
Build and Run Docker Container

docker build -t my-dating-app to build the Docker image.
docker run -d --name netflix -p 8081:80 my-dating-app:latest to run the Docker container and map the container port to your EC2 port.
Go to your EC2 instance and add a rule to the security group to open port 8081.
Access the Application

Copy the public IP of your EC2 instance and browse to http://your_public_ip:8081 to access the application.
That's it! You should now have the "Ask for a Date" app up and running on your EC2 instance.
